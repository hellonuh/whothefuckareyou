# Introduction

The purpose of this project  is to  find out where are my friends today in there life and carrier. So basically a stalker. I am building this because  I have lost touch with my friends and colleagues from college and want to find out how they can help me raise funds for my current state in life.

I am totally fucked right now and need help mainly emotionally but also finacially. I want to tell them my story and invite  them to reconnect and help out each other.

This tool can really help me ask  the right people for the right kind of questions and advice to write my autobiography.

We intend to user all the AI arsenal available to us as of today to learn and understand and do this.

So to keep building we decided to build the login page of the inteface in Android First and then see where we go. 

- Firebase Prj creation : 
    - Enable Authentication
        - Go to firebase console and create a new prj.
        - Go to Auth Section and enable email and Google based login.
        - Go prj setting and enable keys for admin sdk and download it.
    - Enable Hosting.

```

I think we should add three type of login option. mob/otp , email/otp , username/pass, google signin, aadhar/otp signin and aadhar/biometric auth.

Once logged in user should used any method. All should link to one user account in the backend.
